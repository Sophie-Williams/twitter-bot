# twitter-bot
A twitter bot that talks back to you when you tweet at @karmanishth with the substring #helloworld. 


# Tech Stack 
1. Python3.7, pipenv
3. Django 2.1
4. Tweepy

# How it works ?
1. Log in to your twitter account
2. Write a tweet to @karmanishth, make sure you have the keyword #BUZZ (any case) in your tweet.
3. Within 30 seconds of you tweeting, the bot talks back to you in tweet

# Sometimes...
I am not keeping the bot server active 24x7. Although I do strive to keep it always active but sometimes its just sleeping so sorry for that. It will tweet back whenever it comes back up though
